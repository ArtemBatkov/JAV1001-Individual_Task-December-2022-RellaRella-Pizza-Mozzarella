## &emsp;**Description** 
#### &emsp; "RellaRella-PizzaMozzarella" is a prototype of a real-life pizza and other food ordering application with themes and references to the JoJo Bizarre Adventure universe, which is attractive to fans of the series.

<br>

## &emsp;**Technologies**
#### &emsp; The app is strongly focused on Android development. Kotlin was used as a base language.

<br>

## &emsp;**Challanges**
#### &emsp; The main challenge was to take the legacy code as well as the unattractive design of the first version, both of which were rushed, and try to complete a functional application with an attractive interface and provide a better UI/UX.
<br>

## &emsp;**APK** 
#### &emsp; You can download the installation (.apk) file from here <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-P6d77m2W5JYLn4mI663hjef3gAhB_To/view?usp=sharing"> .apk install</a>
&emsp; *or* 
<br> 
&emsp; if you don't want to install it,
&emsp; <a href="https://appetize.io/app/fp6r4m3naq4mxzzuhwt277byfq?device=pixel4&osVersion=11.0&scale=75&audio=true">try online version [strong limited]</a>.
<br>
<br>

##  &emsp;**Restrictions**
#### &emsp; The application does not provide information about a real pizzeria or pizza chain. The application is focused to show what can already be used for orders. For full functionality, it is necessary to coordinate the work of the server part and the application itself. Subsequently, the server part can be worked out with the customer.
<br>

##  &emsp;**Is it free?**
#### &emsp; It is a demo. You can utilize it for free. However, I am looking for a potential customer who needs to buy such type of app that is going to be a deployment one. If you are, please contact me, at hardroid2022@gmail.com
